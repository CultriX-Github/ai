1. Navigate to the day's directory
2. Follow the README instructions in that directory for setup and execution

## Prerequisites

- Python >=3.10 <=3.13
- Poetry (for dependency management)

## General Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   ```
3. Navigate to the specific day's directory
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```
5. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file

## Running a Project

Typically, you can run a day's project with:

```
poetry run python src/day_XX/main.py
```

Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.)
